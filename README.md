You can find here my basic projects that I have been working on as part of self-learning 
The purpose was to study, learn and understand the behaviour of those tools, how they work and what they are able to do
I have uploaded the original file of each tool. Also photos, template and powerpoint file in case you cannot download the file and prefer to see an online view
QlikView, Tableau & PowerBI
